aChat: A real-time chat application, based on WebSockets, used for meeting up with some random strangers and keeping your identity anonymous.
## Description
So this chat application which serves from 00:00 to 01:00 only *:P* , creates an interface of chat between pairs of anonymous users among all the users online.
###### Features
- Real-time interaction with WebSockets
- Video and Audio calls using WebRTC
###### Things to learn
- How to create a basic node chat application, for say 200 users.
- Solving complexities like reconnection after server restart.
- Scaling the server with a cluster of node applications, using docker, and still maintaining an internode connection between all sockets/users.
- Large scaling for a million users and load testing.
___
##### Proposed Tech. Stack
- MERN `MongoDB, ExpressJS, NodeJS, ReactJS`
- [socket.io](https://socket.io/)
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
